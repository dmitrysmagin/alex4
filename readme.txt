INTRODUCTION

Nine times out of ten when I start to write a game, I have planned to make a 
small game. Nine times out of ten, the game grows halfway through the code into
something to big for the code to hold. Usually at this point, I'm to lazy to 
refactor the code so that it can handle the scaling. Instead I hack. Hacking 
is fun, but not very good practice. Still, if it looks right on the screen, 
then it is right. Right? :) 

Anyway, Alex4 started as a small game and grew from there. Hence, the code 
isn't exactly great at some places. Still I think it's quite ok in most places.
What I'm trying to say is that if you're going to learn from this code, don't
take up the bad parts, and don't look at it as the only way. It's just my way.

COMPILING

If you're not content with just reading the code and want to compile it, here's
how. First you need the libraries that Alex4 uses. Allegro and DUMB, get them 
on their web sites:
	
	http://alleg.sf.net	and	http://dumb.sf.net
	
How to install and configure the libraries should be covered in the help files
that comes with the download of each library.

There, having installed libraries, just compile all the source files. Make sure
that you maintain the directory structure so that the c-files can find the 
h-files that they need (mostly in the data/ directory).

If you have any question I suggest that you visit the Free Lunch Design forum,
see below. Please bear in mind that this code is supplied for learning and it
is can not be supported (by Free Lunch Design) in any way.
